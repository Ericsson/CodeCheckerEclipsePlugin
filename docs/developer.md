## Troubleshooting

* In case of compile error, attach the maven output
* Runtime logging is still a big todo, currently most log will appear on stdout/stderr

## Development Notes

* Requires the Tycho Connector, Eclipse will automatically install it for you when you first import the project
* Requires Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Development Environment)
* WindowMaker plugin is recommended
* Adherence to the [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) is mandatory
    * An IntelliJ Idea autoformatter XML configuration file is included in the repo for convenience
